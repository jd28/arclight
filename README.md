# Arclight

### The Goal

This project is to ask, if one was to start today, what would the NWN Toolset?  What would be its features, its goals, and philosophy.  Above all, learn new things.

It accepts from the beginning, maybe there *shouldn't* even be a Toolset and that functionality should be just one other mode of the game (i.e. a devclient.exe, analgous to the dmclient.exe).  But that's something only [Beamdog](https://www.beamdog.com) could do.

### The Philosophy

Unlike other projects of this sort, instead of starting work on some massive project and filling in bits and pieces, this starts with small discrete utilities (see below) whose widgets/functionality can later be welded together to create something that is more than the sum of its parts, that have the modern features one excepts, and that might be useful to others.

## erfherder

* Drag and Drop support.
